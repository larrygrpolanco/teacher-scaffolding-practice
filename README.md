# Teacher Scaffolding Practice Tool

## Overview

This tool is designed to assist language teachers in mastering scaffolding techniquesâ€”an essential pedagogical approach that involves tailoring the level of support provided during the learning process according to the student's needs. Through an interactive simulation, teachers engage in a virtual one-on-one vocabulary lesson with a simulated 4th-grade student. 

The application, crafted with Python and integrating AI technologies, offers scenarios where teachers can practice either escalating (upward scaffolding) or simplifying (downward scaffolding) their teaching strategies in response to simulated student interactions.

## Features

- **Interactive Scaffolding Simulation:** Teachers can select from a list of vocabulary words and decide whether to practice upward or downward scaffolding.
- **Automated Student Responses:** The AI generates responses that mimic those of a 4th-grade student, allowing teachers to concentrate on improving their instructional methods.
- **Feedback System:** At the end of each session, teachers receive feedback on their performance, highlighting effective strategies and areas for improvement.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Teaching Skills:** Helps teachers develop the ability to adjust teaching strategies based on student interactions.
- **Focused Practice:** Provides a targeted approach to practicing educational techniques that are crucial for diverse learning environments.
- **Instant Feedback:** Offers insights into teaching efficacy and suggestions for educational growth.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Vocabulary Word:** Start by selecting a word from the provided list.
2. **Select Scaffolding Direction:** Choose between upward or downward scaffolding to tailor the complexity of your teaching approach.
3. **Engage with Simulated Responses:** Interact with the AI-generated student and adjust your teaching based on their responses.
4. **Receive and Reflect on Feedback:** After the session, review the feedback to understand the effectiveness of your scaffolding techniques.
